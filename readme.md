•	This is the initial task of my project on coherence imaging and microscopy techniques.
•	Developed a Python-based solution to stitch approximately 400 microscopic images into a single high-resolution, magnified image using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Imutils.
•	Implemented parallel processing techniques (e.g., multiprocessing and threading) to significantly reduce computation time. Applied advanced image preprocessing, feature matching, and alignment algorithms for precise and seamless stitching.
